1. generate random list [-10..10] length of 30;
shift all negatives numbers by 1 items right
according to their positions.
positive numbers must stay on their initial positions.
for example:
7,-6,1,2,-3,3,4,5,-1,6,7,-2,8,9,-3,8
7,-3,1,2,-6,3,4,5,-3,6,7,-1,8,9,-2,8

2. revert linked list without 'while'
but with recursion approach

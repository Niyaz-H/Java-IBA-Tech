Warmup task:

You are given an array with random numbers (generate it), length = 20

Sort this array in ascending order

print the original array
print the sorted array

* - you aren't allowed to import even one java module
    to implement sorting. only 'for', 'if', 'while', ..., etc constructs
* - feel free to use any approach to generate an array
    and print it.

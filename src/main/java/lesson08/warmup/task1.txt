You are given the string
which contains 'numbers' and 'non-numbers' separated with spaces

Your task is to calculate the sum of all numbers in this string.
Examples:

input: ''            /      output: 0
input: '1 2 3'       /      output: 6
input: '1 12a 3'     /      output: 4
input: '1 12 3a'     /      output: 13
input: 'asd xcv'     /      output: 0

please consider writing it in THREE separate classes:
1. task implementation
2. application which will be responsible for running your code
3. cover your solution by tests.

Rectangles.
you've been given a random number of rectangles
all of them located horizontally
so, each rectangle represented by two points
a(x1,y1) and b(x2,y2)
they can intersect between each other
they can be nested into each other
they can be separated between each other
Task:
to calculate TOTAL area occupied by rectangles
without intersection duplications.
